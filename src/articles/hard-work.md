Last weekend, it was time to get rid of some grass along the edge of my house. I did this for various reasons:
- Lawns are just about the worst environmental choice one can make.
- I'm tired of mowing grass I don't use.
- I'd rather see some flowers and plants that bring butterflies, bees, and hummingbirds to the yard - as opposed to fire ants.

It took about two days. The first day was spent pulling up the grass that was there. This meant scooping it up, shovelful by shovelful, and dumping it in a wheelbarrow. Then, I hauled it to some woods nearby. In all, this took a full day. 

The second day was all about getting some topsoil down, as well as mulch. This meant heading to a nearby landscaping supply company and getting the truck nice and dirty. While I was unloading my first load, the topsoil, an interesting thing happened.

A young man whose family recently moved in across the street walked over, introduced himself, and asked if I had any trick or tool for pulling up the grass the day before. I replied there was no trick or special tool, just work. I told him I'd gone through three different shirts that day, each one soaked in sweat. It was just a matter of sticking with it. He said he figured that was the case. 

As we were finishing our quick chat, his father came out. He asked the same question about pulling up the grass, but also added that I'd made it look so easy - like I was "scooping up frosting." I replied that I wished it'd been that easy!

This conversation got me thinking about the nature of work, specifically hard work. Back when I was teaching, I often told my students that hard work, in and of itself, isn't enough. After all, washing machines and steamrollers work hard; we don't praise them for it and their reward is often more of the same. 

However, at the time that I was digging and shoveling, I hadn't realized that anyone else was watching. My work that day *meant* something to someone else because it made them think they could do it. I'm not sure what that kid had planned for this week, but now his mother sure has an idea for how he can spend his time!

Hard work is also relative. Sure the work was a little grueling, but I knew exactly what was in store when I began digging. It was just a matter of keeping my head down and doing it. Yet somehow, across the street it looked like I was just flying along. In other words, don't expect hard work to be rewarded: done well, people will often just think it was easy. You'll need something other than outside recognition to keep you going.
