# Why Learning Styles are a Myth
Along with the fact that mitochondria are the powerhouse of the cell, it would seem that one of the main takeaways of early education is the opportunity to learn and embrace one's "learning style."

As you can see from this [Veritasium video](https://youtu.be/rhgwIhB58PA), learning styles are a common enough notion that you can stop most people on the sidewalk and they'll happily share their preferred learning style with you. What's unfortunate is that the notion of learning styles has been thoroughly debunked for decades now. So, why does the myth live on?

The idea of learning styles originally came about [in the 1960s](https://education.msu.edu/green-and-write/2016/do-learning-styles-exist/) and the concept only grew over the next few decades. It's perfectly reasonable that learning styles, as a concept, caught on as they did. After all, it makes intuitive sense that understanding how you learn would help you learn, right? 

Unfortunately, our understanding of how the human brain learns mirrors our grasp of nutrition: a little understanding tends to lead to unfounded conclusions that result in drastic changes - changes that rarely benefit us. In the 80's, fat became the enemy...which led to a rise in the use of sugar and salt...which then led to the inevitable attack on carbohydrates. 

Similarly, many of us seem to have left school armed with how we *can't* learn, not how we can. Our eyes just glaze over during a lecture because, it seems to turn out, some of us just aren't auditory learners. On the other hand, don't show some of us diagrams, because some aren't visual learners. 

So, what is to be made of this learning style phenomenon? How should we tackle our own learning?

## Present the information as it should be presented

Some information is best presented visually, due to its natural complexity. Pretty much no one wants to listen to a half-hour lecture on the parts of an internal combustion engine: show an engine diagram, or, even better, a video walkthrough.
