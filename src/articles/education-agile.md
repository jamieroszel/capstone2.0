Most US high schools still run on the factory model: students go in, content is applied, and graduates emerge. This made sense at the time: standardization was an appealing feature for a country that needed skilled labor. Complex societies require division of labor, and division of labor requires specialized training…which depends on minimum skill level.

Things are quite different now, of course. [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/), [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/) —  and, heck, even YouTube are getting better and better at solving problems and answering questions. Students have more means to find answers than anyone in human history…so why do all my students keep writing the same essay? Maybe the answer is how we as educators are approaching the process.

If you teach high school, then you’ll be familiar with “the grind.” The grind is is the process by which you stay up as late as necessary the night before your essay is due and write…and write…and write. Then, you click ‘save’ and you submit. Every student gets to come in to class the next day and brag about how little they slept — then, once their work has been graded, they get to be surprised by either how well, or how poorly, they did.

The key component to this “method” is the fact that it’s comprehensive and essentially one step long.

**Step One:** Sit down and write, then submit.

That’s it, that is the whole process.

Take this recent [article](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2021/04/homeroom-how-help-your-kid-write-essay/618644/) in *The Atlantic*, for instance. The distraught parent watches her child sit down and always struggle to write an essay: it always ends in tears and anxiety.

This anecdote confirms what I’ve been feeling about writing in the Humanities: it’s holistic and focuses entirely on the end goal. It’s the [waterfall](https://project-management.com/agile-vs-waterfall/) methodology — without any check-in’s. A student just has to sit and grind it out, while likely crying and fearing for their futures. A more [agile](https://project-management.com/agile-vs-waterfall/) approach would make sense.

So, how can we make education, and essay writing, in particular, more agile? Here is what could be done:

#### Break the writing process down into functional steps that are end goals in and of themselves.

Writing is a cohesive art wherein the whole can often be greater than the sum of its parts; however, it’s entirely likely that any given student will never again analyze literature once they leave high school and / or college. This isn’t to say the process has no worth, but there are intrinsically valuable components of the process that are valuable on their own. For instance, I often tell my students to begin *without* the end in mind. The scientific method is predicated on observation, formulation of a testable thesis, experimentation, and result.

There is no reason this process shouldn’t apply to writing. Allow students to read a text (observation), then come up with an idea of what the author’s purpose is (thesis), test that thesis by comparing different textual samples (experimentation), and then reach a conclusion (result).
